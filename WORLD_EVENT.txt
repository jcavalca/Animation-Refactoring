1) There are two event, both triggered by a mouse press: 
						a) Volcano chain (first mouse press)
						b) Ice chain (second mouse press)

2) When the first event is triggered, a volcano chain appears near the location of the mouse press. Conversely, the second produces an ice chain.

3) As time goes on, the volcano chain creates fire dragons and the ice chain createds ice dragons.

4) The fire dragons chase miners and burn them, replacing the burnt miners with a little fire image. The ice dragons, only triggered by a second mouse press, will hunt fire dragons and remove such entities from the animation.
